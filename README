Unix-Shebang version 0.3

Shebang you say? This term also uncommonly and commonly called hashbang or hashpling
is the pair of characters in the first line of a file that causes Unix-like operating systems
to execute the file using the interpreter specified by the rest of the line.
A shebang consists of the two characters, C<#> and C<!> followed by the full path of the interpreter
program and it's arguments. This is a great feature for us interpreter-loving creatures, but it certainly
has its limitations, especially when it comes to script distribution.

One common problem when juggling different perl installations
on the same system, or even when using a different perl location than the more common C</usr/bin/perl>
is the tedious job of changing the interpreter path in the first line of the script.

This module can be used by module authors and end users alike to set the interpreter
to the running perl (or a custom perl interpreter) upon installation of a distribution.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


Or if you prefer to use the Module::Build installation method:

    perl Build.pl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

DEPENDENCIES

IO::File
File::Spec
Getopt::Long;

These should be standard with any modern versions of perl,
but if you happen to be living in a cave somewhere you probably
could fetch them on the CPAN.
